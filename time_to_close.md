*\*Note: Case 1.8 recorded closure date (2024-12-15) precedes its open date (2025-01-10) in the source report, possibly due to a logging error or work completed prior to formal notification. It is excluded from the average duration calculation.*

---

## Methodology

The average time to close was calculated using 19 cases that had explicitly recorded open and closed dates. 
*   **Excluded from Average:** Case 1.8 (date anomaly) and cases marked "Completed" without a specific closure date (1.12, 1.29, 2.1).
*   **Ongoing Cases:** Cases with "Ongoing" status are not included in the duration metrics.

# Comparative Conclusion

Comparing the performance between 2024 and 2025 reveals a significant improvement in the efficiency of case resolution:

*   **2024 Average Time to Close:** 76.2 days
*   **2025 Average Time to Close:** 53.5 days
*   **Net Reduction:** **22.7 days**

This represents a **29.8% reduction** in the average time required to close a successful case. This improvement suggests more streamlined maintenance workflows, faster engineering validation, and enhanced collaboration between the predictive maintenance team and offshore operations in 2025.
