## Vorecon
A **Vorecon** (manufactured by **Voith**) is a high-performance **variable-speed planetary gear**. In the context of offshore vessels (like FPSOs), it is used to control the speed of large compressors.

### 1. Function
It acts as a combination of a **hydrodynamic torque converter** and a **planetary gear**. It allows a constant-speed motor (usually a large electric motor) to drive a compressor at varying speeds. This is much more efficient than using a control valve to throttle the compressor's output.

### 2. Why it's used on FPSOs
*   **Efficiency:** It precisely matches the compressor speed to the required process flow.
*   **Reliability:** It is known for having a very long service life and high power density, which is critical for the limited space on a ship.
*   **Soft Start:** It allows the massive electric motors to start up without putting an enormous load on the ship's power grid.

### 3. Operational Risks (Case 1.29)
The Vorecon is typically designed for high-speed operation. Prolonged operation in low-speed ranges (e.g., below 8,750 rpm) can cause internal gears to work in the opposite direction to the main shaft, leading to accelerated mechanical wear on bearings and bushings.
