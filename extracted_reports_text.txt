Total of 249 new equipment, including new model for MV30 Siemens GTG.Concluded the elaboration of electric Generator prioritized algorithms based on FMEA and performed the basic replication to all GTG generators in the fleet.The two potential scaling cases in MV27 and MV30 identified by PdM tool on Nov 3rdand Oct 28th, respectively, are still under investigation.The scaling model's implementation is not complete due to the lack of sensor historical data. We are now working on the model’s infrastructure to ensure that new techniques could be developed. 
Highlights
Theoretical total loss if PdM was not being used. It is calculated as the sum of Potential Avoided Losses and Non-Avoided Losses.Sum of potential losses avoided by PdM (detection cases). These gains are predicted and are counted after a maintenance notification is issued.Sum of true losses as recorded by MODEC in Salesforce.Subset of Non-Avoided Losses that cannot be avoided by PdM, either by definition(e.g., offloading delays) or due to the lack of required sensing technology. This definition will be updated as situation changes.Subset of Non-Avoided Losses that could have been avoided by PdM(i.e., we have the required sensors installed to monitor the failure mode).Reasons for these failures include coverage gaps (equipment or failure modes for which we do not have a model yet), model failure (our existing models failed to detect the issue), or execution issues (appropriate mitigation action was either not recommended or not executed before the failure happened).

HIGHLIGHTSAnomaly machine learning model was expanded to all compressors and GTG and is presenting good performance.Trend machine learning model is being expanded to new failure modes as VSV position error and Lube Oil High Temperature.New machine learning models as Sensor Quality and Comparison were successfully deployed to compressors and pumps and Lube Oil Leakage to compressors. The total savings with the machine learning models developed in 2023 was approximately $3,0 MM USD.LOWLIGHTSAlthough new machine learning models were successfully developed and deployed, it is being challenge to keep he performance to the newer vessels due lack of data. It was necessary to turn off the trend machine learning to the pumps from MV33 and additionally, the deployment of the anomaly and comparison model to the vessels from MV30 to MV33 are still pending.

METRIC WHAT THE METRIC MEANS
Total Theoretical total loss if PdM was not being used. It is calculated as the sum of the Avoided Losses 
and Actual Losses.
Avoided Losses
Sum of losses avoided by PdM (successful cases).  The successful cases are the events that were 
avoided by PdM generating savings to SPC and approved by MODEC´s Operation Managers and 
Tier 2R team.
Actual Losses Sum of true losses as recorded by MODEC in Salesforce.
Non-Addressable Losses Subset of Losses that cannot be avoided by PdM, either by definition (e.g., offloading delays) or 
due to the lack of required sensing technology. This definition will be updated as situation changes.
Addressable Losses
Subset of Losses that could have been avoided by PdM (i.e., we have the required sensors 
installed to monitor the failure mode).
Reasons for these failures include coverage gaps (equipment or failure modes for which we do not 
have a model yet), model failure (our existing models failed to detect the issue), or execution 
issues (appropriate mitigation action was either not recommended or not executed before the 
failure happened).

FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
▪ The Liquid Carry Over model has been implemented across the entire SPC fleet of VRU, capturing the first success case in November
▪ Workshop FMEA VRU Compressor with MODEC’s Team occurred successfully and already gave us important insights for new SPC fleet monitoring, 
which present opportunities for 2025
▪ Scaling 2.0 under deployment across the entire SPC fleet.
▪ Multiparameter trend model on bearing temperature and bearing vibration deployed in scale to 150+ critical pumps and compressors of SPC fleet 
▪ The alarms acknowledgement of Shape models led to 9 confirmed ML cases and 4 KB cases in the quarter, totaling 44 cases in 2024, resulting in 
approximately 14 million dollars in savings.
FOURTH QUARTER LOWLIGHT
▪ The launch of Lighthouse for the process team experienced a postponement but was successfully executed in 2024.

METRIC WHAT THE METRIC MEANS
Total Theoretical total loss if Lighthouse (LH)  was not being used. It is calculated as the sum of the 
Avoided Losses and Actual Losses .
Avoided Losses
Sum of losses avoided by LH (successful cases).  The successful  cases are the events that 
were avoided by LH generating savings to SPC and approved by MODEC ´s Operation 
Managers and Tier 2R team.
Actual Losses Sum of true losses as recorded by MODEC in Salesforce.
Non Adressable Losses
Subset of Losses that cannot be avoided by LH, either by definition (e.g., offloading  delays) or 
due to the lack of required sensing technology . This definition will be updated as situation 
changes.
Addressable Losses
Subset of Losses that could have been avoided by LH (i.e., we have the required parameters  
installed to monitor the failure mode).
Reasons for these failures include coverage gaps (equipment  or failure modes for which we do 
not have a model yet), model failure (our existing models failed to detect the issue), or 
execution issues (appropriate  mitigation  action was either not recommended  or not executed 
before the failure happened).
LOSSES, $M USD | 2025 JAN-DEC BREAKDOWN OF LOSSES, $M USD | 2025 JAN-DEC
QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
✓ 67% of this year’s cases were closed.
✓ USD 11.61M in Completed Cases during the year (USD 1.45M per vessel).
✓ Achieved USD 18.8M in Successful Cases.
✓ Reduced Total Alarms by 34%.
✓ Shape Intel detected 33% of Q4 cases, demonstrating that the MVP model is already generating measurable 
savings
QUARTER LOWLIGHT
✓ LSTM Anomaly Detection model temporarily failed to send alarms to Lighthouse due to a bug — issue resolved 
in October
✓ The LSTM anomaly detection model underperformed in the 2025 SPC cases backtest, indicating the need for 
tuning.
