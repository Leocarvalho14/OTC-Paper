# Professional Critique: Phase 2 Section

## General Assessment
As a technical paper for OTC, the section is strong on content but requires refinement in tone to transition from a project report to a professional engineering publication. The explanation of the "Asset-Centric Data Model" is a significant technical highlight that addresses a major industry pain point.

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Hypothesis Formatting
In a technical paper, hypotheses should be declarative statements rather than questions. The "What if...?" format is suitable for internal brainstorming but should be presented as a testable engineering goal in the final paper.
*   **Recommendation:** Change "What if...?" to assertive statements like "Implementing logic X will result in outcome Y."

### 2. Redundancy and Flow
The original draft tended to define a challenge and then immediately repeat the context of that challenge in the analysis section.
*   **Recommendation:** Merge the context and analysis to respect the reader's time and improve the narrative flow.

### 3. Voice and Vocabulary
The use of passive voice (e.g., "It was observed by...") weakens the engineering authority of the text. Additionally, some vocabulary is too informal.
*   **Recommendation:**
    *   Use active voice (e.g., "User interviews revealed...").
    *   Replace informal terms like "cryptic tags" with professional terminology like "raw historian identifiers."

### 4. Process vs. Outcome
While the Design Thinking for Innovation (DTI) framework was the methodology used, the paper should focus more on the engineering outcomes and structural shifts rather than the process terminology itself.

## Action Plan Applied
1.  **Converted Hypotheses** from questions to declarative technical statements.
2.  **Removed redundancy** in the "Asset-Centric" section to improve flow.
3.  **Sharpened vocabulary** to match industry standards (e.g., "Normalized" and "Abstraction").
