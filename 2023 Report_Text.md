Quarterly reportJanuary – December 2023WHAT THE METRIC MEANSMETRICTheoretical total loss if PdM was not being used. It is calculated as the sum of the Avoided Losses and Actual Losses.TotalSum of losses avoided by PdM (successful cases). The successful cases are the events that were avoided by PdM generating savings to SPC and approved by MODEC´s Operation Managers and Tier 2R team.Avoided LossesSum of true losses as recorded by MODEC in Salesforce.Actual LossesSubset of Losses that cannot be avoided by PdM, either by definition (e.g., offloading delays) or due to the lack of required sensing technology. This definition will be updated as situation changes.Non-Addressable LossesSubset of Losses that could have been avoided by PdM(i.e., we have the required sensors installed to monitor the failure mode).Reasons for these failures include coverage gaps (equipment or failure modes for which we do not have a model yet), model failure (our existing models failed to detect the issue), or execution issues (appropriate mitigation action was either not recommended or not executed before the failure happened).Addressable LossesLOSSES, $M USD | 2023 JAN-DECBREAKDOWN OF LOSSES, $M USD | 2023 JAN-DEC
HIGHLIGHTSAnomaly machine learning model was expanded to all compressors and GTG and is presenting good performance.Trend machine learning model is being expanded to new failure modes as VSV position error and Lube Oil High Temperature.New machine learning models as Sensor Quality and Comparison were successfully deployed to compressors and pumps and Lube Oil Leakage to compressors. The total savings with the machine learning models developed in 2023 was approximately $3,0 MM USD.LOWLIGHTSAlthough new machine learning models were successfully developed and deployed, it is being challenge to keep he performance to the newer vessels due lack of data. It was necessary to turn off the trend machine learning to the pumps from MV33 and additionally, the deployment of the anomaly and comparison model to the vessels from MV30 to MV33 are still pending.

Quarterly reportJanuary – December 2023Machine Learning Models GlossaryDefinitionMachine Learning ModelThe Machine Learning model uses an advanced algorithm called 'Elliptic Envelope’. Thenormal operations behavior of the equipment can be depicted within an imaginary contoursimilar to an ellipse. What our model does is sketch this ellipse based on normaloperational patterns. The model is designed to monitor multiple subsystems of the sameequipment, averaging 50 sensors. Each subsystem, including electric motor, equipmentparts, gearbox, has an independent model. The final health score of the equipment isderived from the combination of these subsystems, allowing for a comprehensive andaccurate understanding of the overall state. This design enables us to act promptly,ensuring efficiency and minimizing unexpected downtimesAnomaly Detection ModelThis Machine Learning model alerts when one or more redundant sensor start drifting fromthe others of the group. The algorithm underneath this model is multivariate and can beapplied to any number of redundant sensors, evaluating all combinations of pairs betweenthe group. If any of the pair combinations drift, the model will alarm. The premise behindthe comparison model is that one redundant sensor must not drift from the behavior of itspairs. It employs two data drift detection techniques to evaluate if the sensors are losingparity, always confronting one sensor against the other. The first technique is to evaluate ifthe root mean squared error between the sensors is increasing in comparison to itshistorical value. This detects when the offset of one sensor varies, and the other doesn’t.The second technique retrieves the distribution of the values of each sensor in a windowand calculate the Kullback–Leibler distance between them. This detects when one of thesensors varies its behavior differently from the other. The parameters for both techniquesare defined and adjusted based on the past behavior of each pair
Comparison
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors, which is a machine learning technique designed toclassify new data based on the closest previous data that has already been classified.The difference between traditional KNN and the Online approach is that the latter canadapt to the most recent datapoints. Because of that, the model doesn't need retrainingand can handle changes in operation by itself.KNNThe Machine Learning model used in this case (LSTM – Long-Short Term Memory) learnthe behavior for multiple sensors overtime, utilizing historical and incoming data to detectabnormalities, which can yield to equipment failure. The alarm trigger is trained to discoveranomalies considering every sensor present in the model without the need to predefine aspecific rule. It focuses on deviations between the expected and the actual values in a waythat make possible to capture intricate patterns and dependencies in data. This capabilityallows it to effectively detect increased trip risk and generate actionable insights, enablingproactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure smooth equipment operationLSTMThis machine learning model monitors oil usage while the machine is operational and infersthe presence of an oil leakage condition. It employs a windowed linear regressiontechnique that calculates the mean slope for each segment of the preceding 90 days ofdata. The model differentiates between short-term leakage, indicating an abrupt leakageduring a single machine operation cycle, and long-term leakage, indicating a subtleleakage that may require observation over multiple cycles to be detected, often occurringafter several weeks. The model is designed taken into consideration stability in lowinclination, potential fluctuations in high inclination, and the variable nature of oil leakageoccurrences.Lube Oil LeakageThe machine learning model used in this case (One-Class SVM) is trained only on datawhich lies inside the specified range of equipment’s datasheet and creates a smooth closedboundary around the data cloud. The boundary separates the normal data from theanomalies, which is outside from the optimal region for machine operation. Duringinference, the risk is calculated based on the relative position of the data points to thelearned boundary.OCSVMThis Machine Learning model is designed to detect rising trend signals in heavyengineering equipment sensors. Its primary value lies in providing the engineering teamwith early warnings about abnormal behaviors, well before machines reach criticalconditions or shutdown scenarios. Its methodology is based on statistical differences,particularly the exponential moving averages of sensor data. With training data from eachsensor, the model precisely predicts when signals are beginning to exhibit abnormalelevations. Additionally, the model is equipped to monitor all equipment datasimultaneously. Sensors are grouped based on their characteristics, such as temperature,vibration, and pressure, thus optimizing performance for each set. This results in moreprecise and contextualized alerts, facilitating alerts investigations and informed actions,and offering a more reliable view of the equipment's overall state.Trend Algorithm (Tendency)

•When and how SHAPE PdM model detected the issue?On March 26th, the Shape PdM machine learning model raised an alarm pointing out to an abnormality at the turbine exhaust temperature. It was identified that two of the readings started to diverge from its normal behavior, when compared with the other 8 sensors monitoring the turbine combustor, for the given operational condition.•Why wouldn´t operations identify the issue if there was no SHAPE PdM?This type of abnormal behavior as spurious peaks at the temperature readings are not automatically detectable by any alarm in the operator control room.•What could happen to the equipment if there was no SHAPE PdM?If the third sensor presents the same behavior and reach the triplimit,  an emergency stoppage of the machine may occur, causing a potential internal parts damage scenario. •What happened after the issue was identified by SHAPE PdM?An SAP notification (11078574) was raised to perform a planned corrective maintenance intervention in the next opportunity on the vessel maintenance schedule.

Quarterly reportJanuary – December 2023CASE 1.2 | MV26 –Sea Water Injection Pump presenting signs of misalignmentACTION STATUSMODELING APPROACHNOTIFICATION DATEOngoingMachine Learning2023-03-31EVENT DESCRIPTIONThe centrifugal pump, currently monitored by 39 online sensors, had a coupling vibration anomaly alarm in PdM application on March 31stshowing signs of misalignmentin pump DE side. Misalignment between the pump and motor coupling can lead unexpected trip or bearing damages. The machine learning model identified anomalybehaviors simultaneously on 4 signals of coupling vibration sensors, indicating a risk of pump´s damage. Those changes in trends does not trigger any other alarm toonshore or offshore team except the PdM and those trends are not isolated monitored by any means.
SPECIALIST’S RECOMMENDATIONCheck coupling (shims quantity/length, bolts tightening, DBFF, and integrity conditions) as per Coupling drawing (0381-90-1545-G16-0029) and INS-1517 (Coupling visual inspection). Check pump shaft alignment (parallel and angular) as per INS-1517 (Coupling visual inspection). Check electric motor shims, soft foot, and bolts tightening as per INS-1517 (Coupling visual inspection). Notification: 11095412.SAVING ASSESSMENT

EVENT SUMMARY•March 31st- MV26_VI-1545A-01.PV, MV26_VI-1545A-02.PV, MV26_VI-1545A-13.PV, MV26_VI-1545A-14.PVtrends stated to show anomalous behavior.•After the PdM alarmed, MODEC engineeringanalysis confirmed that this vibration behaviorchange is related to misalignment between thepump and motor coupling, leading to a correctiveaction to inspect and align coupling.•The rotational axes of the two connected shaftswere not properly aligned, causing misalignmentbetween them. This misalignment puts additionalstress on the coupling and other connectedcomponents, leading to accelerated wear, fatigue,and potential damage to the centrifugal pump.•This machine learning model is crucial to identifythis anomaly, once it is necessary to check thebehavior patterns between the pump and themotor's 4 sensors at the same time, which is notdetectable in normal circumstances just by thechanges in the absolute values of the vibrationsseparately.

This case might berelated to lack of concentricity between shafts.•MODECengineering analysis of PdM alarm confirmed that thiscase is related to alack of concentricity between shaftsthat iscausing an increasing tendency and recommended a correctiveaction to avoid an equipment trip or even a possible internalparts damage.•The early detection of this subtle issue by PdM, before any othermeans, gives enough time to analyze, diagnose and treat theproblem in due time. Further, the offshore operations teamwould not perceive this anomaly without the Machine Learningmodel because it should be necessary to check the behaviorpatterns changes between the bearing vibration sensorshistorical data and correlate it with the historical machineoperational condition (such as pressures, flow and electricmotor current), which in this case is not detectable by theoperator – or even cannot monitor all the 12 sensors at once.•Condition is being monitored until the execution of thecorrective action (SAP Notification: 11228808).•If vibration continues to rise it’s expected the shortening ofbearing service life and possible equipment trip.Anomaly model:The Machine Learning model uses an advanced algorithm called 'EllipticEnvelope’. The normal operations behavior of the equipment can be depicted within animaginary contour similar to an ellipse. What our model does is sketch this ellipse based onnormal operational patterns.

OCSVM Model:This alarm was generated by the high-dimensional OCSVM algorithm to distinguish betweennormal values and anomalies. The model's strategy is toutilize historical data from normal operations to learn anautonomous decision function capable of determining whensomething abnormal is occurring. It also relies on efficiencycurve specifications provided by the equipmentmanufacturers, which are determined under optimallaboratory conditions but not optimized for the actualoperating conditions on the FPSO production site. Hence, themodel performs data-driven adjustments to these curves toalign them with the real operational conditions encounteredin day-to-day operations.
