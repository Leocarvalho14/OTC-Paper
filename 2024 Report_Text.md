METRIC WHAT THE METRIC MEANS
Total Theoretical total loss if PdM was not being used. It is calculated as the sum of the Avoided Losses 
and Actual Losses.
Avoided Losses
Sum of losses avoided by PdM (successful cases).  The successful cases are the events that were 
avoided by PdM generating savings to SPC and approved by MODEC´s Operation Managers and 
Tier 2R team.
Actual Losses Sum of true losses as recorded by MODEC in Salesforce.
Non-Addressable Losses Subset of Losses that cannot be avoided by PdM, either by definition (e.g., offloading delays) or 
due to the lack of required sensing technology. This definition will be updated as situation changes.
Addressable Losses
Subset of Losses that could have been avoided by PdM (i.e., we have the required sensors 
installed to monitor the failure mode).
Reasons for these failures include coverage gaps (equipment or failure modes for which we do not 
have a model yet), model failure (our existing models failed to detect the issue), or execution 
issues (appropriate mitigation action was either not recommended or not executed before the 
failure happened).

FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
▪ The Liquid Carry Over model has been implemented across the entire SPC fleet of VRU, capturing the first success case in November
▪ Workshop FMEA VRU Compressor with MODEC’s Team occurred successfully and already gave us important insights for new SPC fleet monitoring, 
which present opportunities for 2025
▪ Scaling 2.0 under deployment across the entire SPC fleet.
▪ Multiparameter trend model on bearing temperature and bearing vibration deployed in scale to 150+ critical pumps and compressors of SPC fleet 
▪ The alarms acknowledgement of Shape models led to 9 confirmed ML cases and 4 KB cases in the quarter, totaling 44 cases in 2024, resulting in 
approximately 14 million dollars in savings.
FOURTH QUARTER LOWLIGHT
▪ The launch of Lighthouse for the process team experienced a postponement but was successfully executed in 2024.

It was identified in the measurements 
that the resistance in the main element 
was intermittent in the closed circuit 
measured values. The interconnection 
wiring circuit was opened and the 
resistance between the conductors and 
insulation resistance was measured; no 
shorts or low insulation were found. 
Check of the interconnection wiring and 
preventive retightening of the 
interconnections. After inspection and 
retightening of the interconnection 
wiring and reconnection of the 
temperature element, the failure was 
normalized. Instrument is in normal 
operating condition and without faults.

Machine Learning Models Glossary
Machine Learning 
Model
Definition
Anomaly Detection Model The Machine Learning model uses an advanced algorithm called 'Elliptic Envelope’. The normal operations behavior of the 
equipment can be depicted within an imaginary contour similar to an ellipse. What our model does is sketch this ellipse 
based on normal operational patterns. The model is designed to monitor multiple subsystems of the same equipment, 
averaging 50 sensors. Each subsystem, including electric motor, equipment parts,  gearbox, has an independent model. 
The final health score of the equipment is derived from the combination of these subsystems, allowing for a 
comprehensive and accurate understanding of the overall state. This design enables us to act promptly, ensuring 
efficiency and minimizing unexpected downtimes
Comparison The Comparison Machine Learning model is a multivariate model designed to detect when one or more sensors deviate 
from the values of a group of similar or redundant sensors. This algorithm can be applied to any number of sensors that 
are expected to behave similarly. It evaluates all possible pair combinations, computes relevant metrics, and checks if any 
of the sensors’ values are drifting from the expected behavior. The premise of the comparison model is that the values of 
one or more sensors should not deviate from the behavior of their counterparts. There are three main drift detection 
techniques used to evaluate whether a sensor or a group of sensors is losing parity: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), 
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence), and Root Mean Variance (RMV). These techniques are applied based on the 
number of sensors being monitored. If a pair of sensors is analyzed, RMSE and KL-divergence are computed for each, and 
the metrics are compared to reference values (baseline values where the sensors' measurements are considered reliable). 
In contrast, when comparing a group of three or more sensors, the average KL-divergence is calculated for all sensor pair 
permutations, and the RMV of all sensors is computed at each timestamp. These metrics are then compared to the 
reference values.
KNN KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors, which is a machine learning technique designed to classify new data based on the 
closest previous data that has already been classified. 
The difference between traditional KNN and the Online approach is that the latter can adapt to the most recent 
datapoints. Because of that, the model doesn't need retraining and can handle changes in operation by itself.
LSTM The Machine Learning model used in this case (LSTM – Long-Short Term Memory) learn the behavior for multiple sensors 
overtime, utilizing historical and incoming data to detect abnormalities, which can yield to equipment failure. The alarm 
trigger is trained to discover anomalies considering every sensor present in the model without the need to predefine a 
specific rule. It focuses on deviations between the expected and the actual values in a way that make possible to capture 
intricate patterns and dependencies in data. This capability allows it to effectively detect increased trip risk and generate 
actionable insights, enabling proactive measures to mitigate risks and ensure smooth equipment operation
Lube Oil Leakage This machine learning model monitors oil usage while the machine is operational and infers the presence of an oil leakage 
condition. It employs a windowed linear regression technique that calculates the mean slope for each segment of the 
preceding 90 days of data. The model differentiates between short-term leakage, indicating an abrupt leakage during a 
single machine operation cycle, and long-term leakage, indicating a subtle leakage that may require observation over 
multiple cycles to be detected, often occurring after several weeks. The model is designed taken into consideration 
stability in low inclination, potential fluctuations in high inclination, and the variable nature of oil leakage occurrences.
OCSVM The machine learning model used in this case (One-Class SVM) is trained only on data which lies inside the specified 
range of equipment’s datasheet and creates a smooth closed boundary around the data cloud. The boundary separates 
the normal data from the anomalies, which is outside from the optimal region for machine operation. During inference, 
the risk is calculated based on the relative position of the data points to the learned boundary.
Trend Algorithm 
(Tendency)
This Machine Learning model is designed to detect rising trend signals in heavy engineering equipment sensors. Its 
primary value lies in providing the engineering team with early warnings about abnormal behaviors, well before machines 
reach critical conditions or shutdown scenarios. Its methodology is based on statistical differences, particularly the 
exponential moving averages of sensor data. With training data from each sensor, the model precisely predicts when 
signals are beginning to exhibit abnormal elevations. Additionally, the model is equipped to monitor all equipment data 
simultaneously. Sensors are grouped based on their characteristics, such as temperature, vibration, and pressure, thus 
optimizing performance for each set. This results in more precise and contextualized alerts, facilitating alerts 
investigations and informed actions, and offering a more reliable view of the equipment's overall state.
Sensor Quality This Ensemble Machine learning model uses three techniques to analyze all temperature and vibration sensors of an 
equipment combined to check data quality and if the equipment are in normal conditions of functioning. The techniques 
are: Flatline, Spikes and Instability. The Flatline model is implemented using Genetic Algorithms combined with 
reinforcement learning to detect invariable regions in the signal for a long period of time. The Spikes model uses a 
moving average window approach that simulates the expected machine behavior to compare with the original signal to 
identify abrupt increases in the signals, detecting possible behaviors that may lead to equipment malfunction. The 
Instability model uses a time frame to inspect if the signals are above normal behavior for a long period.
Liquid Carryover The Machine Learning model used in this case is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network, also known as a 
Feedforward Neural Network. It was trained using data representing both behaviors indicative of the Liquid Carryover 
event and normal operational data, validated by Modec engineers. The model’s output represents the probability that the 
input data corresponds to a potential Liquid Carryover event, based on its similarity to fault periods observed during 
training. It computes correlations between input features, including the foam index, temperature after crude heaters, 
defoamer flow and concentration, electrostatic treater level, gas flow, and VRU scrubber level, to generate predictions.
Additionally, the model can provide insights into the contribution of each feature to its predictions, enabling users to 
identify the most important features that triggered an alarm.

CASE 1.6 | MV26 – Pump presenting signs of coupling issues and bearing damage
NOTIFICATION DATE MODELING APPROACH ACTION STATUS
2023-09-02 Machine Learning Ongoing
EVENT DESCRIPTION
The Shape PdM System has issued an alarm for the SWIP Pump, currently monitored by 37 online sensors, regarding an increasing 
vibration trend, which indicates signs of incipient failure modes in both the coupling and pump bearings (on the drive-end and non-
drive-end sides). If left unaddressed, these issues could result in damage to the coupling and bearings, potentially leading to an 
unexpected shutdown. Machine learning analysis has revealed patterns in the behavior of both bearings, suggesting an elevated risk of 
damage to the pump.
SPECIALIST’S RECOMMENDATION
1.  Check coupling (shims quantity/length, bolts tightening, DBFF, and integrity conditions) as per design documents.
2. Check pump shaft alignment (parallel and angular) as per design documents.
3. Check electric motor shims, soft foot, and bolts tightening as per design documents.
4. Check diametral clearance of pump shaft x radial bearing. In case of improper diametral clearance, the radial bearings must be replaced, and shaft inspection must be 
carried out. (Notification: 11502418)

EVENT DESCRIPTION
Shape System for scaling models identified discrepancies between the measured flow rate and the oil side differential pressure after an 
instrument calibration on January 13, 2024. As shown in Figure 1, there was a slight increase in oil pressure (indicated by the red line), 
while the flow rate remained constant, suggesting potential scaling in the Crude Heater. Figure 2 features the green curve plotted using 
datasheet values within a 15% tolerance margin (shown by the orange curves). This analysis highlights a risk of scaling formation, as the 
data points for differential pressure fall outside the expected range.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
PdM tool for scaling models detected an increasing tendency on the crude heater failure risk model (Figure 1). This model uses the 
measured oil flowrate (FWKOD + Test Separator) and the oil side differential pressure as inlet parameters. Findings revealed, according to 
Figure 2, that the oil pressure drop did not go down even with the decreasing flow tendency (indicated by the blue line). It was also 
notice higher dP with low flowrates, indicating signs of scaling in the Crude Heater. In Figure 3, the green curve (located in the middle) 
was plotted using data from the datasheet, with a 15% tolerance margin considered (represented by the orange curves). It is possible to 
observe a scaling formation risk because data points from the differential pressure deviate from the expected range.

Description of the Corrective Notification:
Inspect the temperature sensor - MV27-TE-1545C-32-8P - and its 
facilities, like cables, connections and JB.
Activities:
An initial check was carried out on the TE-1545C-32-8P temperature 
element of the bearing on the drive end of the PBE-1545C pump, and 
no mechanical damage or installation failure of the temperature 
element was identified. Measures the thermoresistance of the 
temperature element (PT100 2 x 3 wires), one for main monitoring and 
the other as a spare. It was identified in the measurements that the 
resistance in the main element was intermittent in the closed circuit 
measured values. The interconnection wiring circuit was opened and 
the resistance between the conductors and insulation resistance was 
measured; no shorts or low insulation were found. Check of the 
interconnection wiring and preventive retightening of the 
interconnections. After inspection and retightening of the 
interconnection wiring and reconnection of the temperature element, 
the failure was normalized. Instrument is in normal operating 
condition and without faults.

Activities:
Visual inspection to identify possible hydraulic leaks.
Comments:
Visual inspection observed a hydraulic leak on the 
Gearbox output shaft for the injection pump. No 
apparent signs of hydraulic leak in the engine.
It will be necessary to stop the equipment and remove 
the coupling protection for a better diagnosis.
Abnormality is already mapped and will be handled by 
commissioning and vendor.
