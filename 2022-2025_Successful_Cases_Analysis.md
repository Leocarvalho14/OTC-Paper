# Analysis of Successful Cases (2022-2025)

## Executive Summary
The program has demonstrated **consistent year-over-year growth in total value**, rising from **$4.5M in 2022** to **$18.6M in 2025**. While the *number* of cases peaked in 2023, the *value per case* has increased significantly in later years, indicating a shift towards detecting higher-impact, more critical failures (such as complex physical failures and scaling events). There was also a decisive technological shift in 2024, moving from primarily "Knowledge-Based" detections to "Machine Learning" driven detections.

## 1. Financial Impact (Total Value)
*   **2022:** $4,492,137
*   **2023:** $13,360,346 (Approx. **3x** increase over 2022)
*   **2024:** $14,139,761 (**+6%** growth)
*   **2025:** $18,560,324 (**+31%** growth)

**Trend:** The program has sustained the massive gains achieved in 2023 and continued to accelerate value generation, reaching a record high in 2025.

## 2. Efficiency (Value per Case)
*   **2022:** ~$195k / case (23 cases)
*   **2023:** ~$238k / case (56 cases)
*   **2024:** ~$307k / case (46 cases)
*   **2025:** **~$501k / case** (37 cases)

**Trend:** The case count peaked in 2023. Since then, the volume of cases has decreased, but the **average value per case has more than doubled**. This suggests the system is becoming more precise, focusing on high-value, catastrophic avoidance rather than minor sensor anomalies.

## 3. Evolution of Failure Modes
*   **Scaling:** Consistently the "Heavy Hitter."
    *   In 2022, 3 cases = $1.6M.
    *   In 2025, 3 cases = **$6.0M**.
    *   Early detection of scaling has become a massive value driver.
*   **Physical Failures (Rotating Equipment):**
    *   2023 saw a flood of these issues (38 cases, $9.1M).
    *   By 2025, the count dropped (14 cases), but the value remained nearly as high ($8.6M), implying detection of much more severe mechanical issues.
*   **New Capabilities (Liquid Carry Over - LCO):**
    *   LCO detection emerged in 2024 (1 case) and continued in 2025 (2 cases).
    *   These are extremely high-value events, averaging nearly **$1M per occurrence**.

---

## 4. Technological Maturity (Detection Type)
*   **2022 & 2023:** Dominated by **Knowledge-Based** rules (74% and 70% of cases, respectively).
*   **2024:** A massive pivot occurred. **Machine Learning** became the dominant engine, accounting for **74% of all cases** (34 ML vs 10 Knowledge).
*   **2025:** The complexity of cases (LCO, Scaling, complex vibrations) suggests this reliance on advanced analytics has persisted.

## Conclusion
The 2022-2025 period demonstrates a clear path of **maturation**:
1.  **2022-2023 (Ramping Up):** Focus on broad coverage and volume.
2.  **2024-2025 (Refining and Scaling):** Shift to Machine Learning and focus on high-impact, complex failures, maximizing ROI per alert.
