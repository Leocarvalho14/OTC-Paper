METRIC WHAT THE METRIC MEANS
Total Theoretical total loss if Lighthouse (LH)  was not being used. It is calculated as the sum of the 
Avoided Losses and Actual Losses .
Avoided Losses
Sum of losses avoided by LH (successful cases).  The successful  cases are the events that 
were avoided by LH generating savings to SPC and approved by MODEC ´s Operation 
Managers and Tier 2R team.
Actual Losses Sum of true losses as recorded by MODEC in Salesforce.
Non Adressable Losses
Subset of Losses that cannot be avoided by LH, either by definition (e.g., offloading  delays) or 
due to the lack of required sensing technology . This definition will be updated as situation 
changes.
Addressable Losses
Subset of Losses that could have been avoided by LH (i.e., we have the required parameters  
installed to monitor the failure mode).
Reasons for these failures include coverage gaps (equipment  or failure modes for which we do 
not have a model yet), model failure (our existing models failed to detect the issue), or 
execution issues (appropriate  mitigation  action was either not recommended  or not executed 
before the failure happened).
LOSSES, $M USD | 2025 JAN-DEC BREAKDOWN OF LOSSES, $M USD | 2025 JAN-DEC
QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
✓ 67% of this year’s cases were closed.
✓ USD 11.61M in Completed Cases during the year (USD 1.45M per vessel).
✓ Achieved USD 18.8M in Successful Cases.
✓ Reduced Total Alarms by 34%.
✓ Shape Intel detected 33% of Q4 cases, demonstrating that the MVP model is already generating measurable 
savings
QUARTER LOWLIGHT
✓ LSTM Anomaly Detection model temporarily failed to send alarms to Lighthouse due to a bug — issue resolved 
in October
✓ The LSTM anomaly detection model underperformed in the 2025 SPC cases backtest, indicating the need for 
tuning.

Machine Learning Models Glossary
Machine Learning 
Model
Definition
FM - Multivariate 
Anomaly Detection for 
Compressor
The anomaly detection model uses an LSTM neural network that learns how the equipment behaves over time. Instead of 
analyzing isolated points, it understands how temperatures, pressures, vibrations, and flows naturally evolve during stable 
operation. Once deployed, it continuously compares real-time sequences to these learned patterns. When behavior 
deviates consistently, through subtle drifts or combined parameter changes, the model flags an anomaly and generates 
an alert. By focusing on temporal behavior rather than single values, the LSTM provides earlier and more contextual 
warnings, helping engineers act before issues escalate into failures, efficiency losses, or unplanned downtime.
Anomaly Detection Model
The Machine Learning model uses an advanced algorithm called 'Elliptic Envelope’. The normal operations behavior of the 
equipment can be depicted within an imaginary contour similar to an ellipse. What our model does is sketch this ellipse 
based on normal operational patterns. The model is designed to monitor multiple subsystems of the same equipment, 
averaging 50 parameters. Each subsystem, including electric motor, equipment parts,  gearbox, has an independent 
model. The final health score of the equipment is derived from the combination of these subsystems, allowing for a 
comprehensive and accurate understanding of the overall state. This design enables us to act promptly, ensuring 
efficiency and minimizing unexpected downtimes.
Shape Intel
This Machine Learning model uses a non-parametric algorithm from the CART family to learn normal operational behavior 
and identify deviations that may indicate abnormal conditions. Once a potential anomaly is detected, a Large Language 
Model (LLM) evaluates the event, determines the most plausible failure mode, and generates a clear, contextualized 
engineering explanation. By combining machine-learning detection with LLM-based reasoning, the Shape Intel model 
offers fast identification, transparent diagnostics, and natural-language insights that accelerate investigations, reduce 
ambiguity, and enable engineering and operations teams to take confident, data-driven actions.
Advanced Bearing 
Vibration & Temperature 
Increase Detection
This machine learning model detects rising trends in bearing vibration and temperature by analyzing multiple parameters 
that represent the machine’s true operating conditions. Rather than evaluating these signals in isolation, it monitors 
patterns in key process variables such as discharge pressure, motor current, lubrication oil temperature, and axial 
displacement during the trend event. When an abnormal evolution is identified, the model also indicates whether 
meaningful process changes occurred at the same time. This multiparameter approach improves diagnostic clarity, 
reduces ambiguity, and provides engineers with earlier and more contextual insights to support timely and confident 
maintenance decisions.
Advanced Lube Oil 
Leakage
This machine learning model detects abnormal patterns in the lube oil system by analyzing level, pressure, and differential 
pressure signals simultaneously. It captures characteristic leakage behaviors by combining smoothed signal trends, 
rolling-slope analysis, and robust MAD-based thresholds. This allows the model to identify both weekly and slowly 
developing downtrends while filtering out normal rundown-tank dynamics and transient effects caused by system on/off 
transitions. By integrating multiple indicators into a unified ensemble, the model increases sensitivity, reduces false 
positives, and provides earlier, clearer detection of true leakage events, enabling more reliable and timely maintenance 
decisions.
Comparison (Abnormal 
Instrument Reading)
This machine learning model uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to learn the normal relationships between redundant 
or highly correlated signals. Instead of relying on predefined metrics, the SVM maps the joint behavior of these 
parameters and identifies when any of them drifts away from the expected pattern. By learning both normal and 
abnormal regions of operation, the model captures subtle discrepancies, asymmetries, and signal-specific particularities 
that traditional pairwise metrics may miss. This approach strengthens sensitivity to early deviations, reduces false alarms, 
and delivers a more robust, adaptive comparison framework for detecting loss of parity among similar sensors.
OCSVM
The machine learning model used in this case (One-Class SVM) is trained only on data which lies inside the specified 
range of equipment’s datasheet and creates a smooth closed boundary around the data cloud. The boundary separates 
the normal data from the anomalies, which is outside from the optimal region for machine operation. During inference, 
the risk is calculated based on the relative position of the data points to the learned boundary.
Liquid Carryover
The Machine Learning model used in this case is a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network, also known as a 
Feedforward Neural Network. It was trained using data representing both behaviors indicative of the Liquid Carryover 
event and normal operational data, validated by Modec engineers. The model’s output represents the probability that the 
input data corresponds to a potential Liquid Carryover event, based on its similarity to fault periods observed during 
training. It computes correlations between input features, including the foam index, temperature after crude heaters, 
defoamer flow and concentration, electrostatic treater level, gas flow, and VRU scrubber level, to generate predictions.
Additionally, the model can provide insights into the contribution of each feature to its predictions, enabling users to 
identify the most important features that triggered an alarm.
KNN
KNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors, which is a machine learning technique designed to classify new data 
based on the closest previous data that has already been classified. 
The difference between traditional KNN and the Online approach is that the latter can adapt to the most 
recent datapoints. Because of that, the model doesn't need retraining and can handle changes in operation 
by itself.
OCSVM
The machine learning model used in this case (One-Class SVM) is trained only on data which lies inside the 
specified range of equipment’s datasheet and creates a smooth closed boundary around the data cloud. The 
boundary separates the normal data from the anomalies, which is outside from the optimal region for 
machine operation. During inference, the risk is calculated based on the relative position of the data points to 
the learned boundary.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
Shape Lighthouse triggered a series of alarms for the LCO Model on the MV33 VRU Compression System mostly related to below target defoamer 
injection coupled with slightly lower operating temperature in the 2nd Stage Degasser. MODEC Engineering team acknowledged the alarm with the 
chemicals team, leading to the operations team taking countermeasures to prevent potential damage to the VRU Compressor. Due to ramp-up in 
production occurring steadily in the FPSO until full capacity is reached, increased surveillance is necessary. A technical session with the operations team 
is planned in April to delve into model’s novel approach to proactively detect production upsets that can lead to LCO, focusing on the process variables 
combinations observed to contribute the most to the event likelihood.

Figure 2 – Vibrationson Compressor bearingsfrom Feb 1st to Mar 24th.
Rate reduction and penalty losses are maintained for intermediate scenario despite spare compressor and previous SPC questioning due to the following:
From a practical standpoint, it is fair to assume there should be little immediate rate reduction or penalty loss in case current operating compressor fails and
the spare compressor is started. That said, if current compressor fails due to LCO with no prior knowledge of that being the cause, it's unlikely that the spare
compressor isn't also affected by LCO given that the process root cause isn’t addressed for some time until the failure cause is investigated. 
LCO Model alerts to the root causes even before the main compressor is affected, in this way preventing damage not only to the main compressor but also
potential damage to the spare given the scenario indicated above.
VIbration alarms on compressor bearings by themselves aren't enough to determine an LCO event is taking place as there are many possible causes. 
Aligning time frames from the LCO model alarm trends and excessive vibration levels on the machine makes it possible to infer LCO events, especially if the
upset is reduced/removed after adequate process adjustments.

EVENT DESCRIPTION 
Lighthouse  generated an alarm appointing  a decreasing  tendency behavior on lube oil level in SWIP-C measurements,  currently 
monitored  with 91 online parameters . The machine was in normal operational  conditions  however; a suspect behavior was identified in 
LI1572-01.PV. As next steps, an inspection  was carried out on the entire lubrication  system and a leak was detected through the labyrinth 
in the bearing on the coupled side of the electric motor on WO 11872835. After this procedure,  another SAP note (11967478) was 
generated because it is necessary to open the bearing and evaluate the sealing components . Consequently,  Shape System prevented 
damage to internal parts damage from electric motor due to oil contamination .

EVENT DESCRIPTION 
Lighthouse generated an alarm appointing an abnormal behavior on primary seal gas filter on MAIN A measurements, currently monitored with 79 
online parameters. When the compressor was stopped, an inspection was conducted to check for oil in the suction, discharge, and machine casing 
drains which can be seen on Figure 2. After that, higher rates of increase in differential pressure was detected during start up on primary seal gas filter 
which may be attributed to the accumulation of oil in the filter element. It is believed that this can be explained by the fact that the drain is located 
downstream of the system filter. So that, Shape system prevented lube oil contamination on compressor internal parts.

Activities:
Sensor TE-2257-49 was indicating 40°C and TE-2257-51 (installed 
next to TE-2257-49) indicated 63°C. Initially, the sensors were 
checked in the field. The resistance values ​​of both sensors were 
correct and consistent with each other. When performing  a test 
by reversing the sensor cables on JB 5S-ISJB-2202A-84 (JB-33), it 
was observed that the indications  on the FCS were reversed (TE-
2257-49 indicating  63°C and TE-2257-51 indicating  40°C), 
signaling  a possible fault in the pepperl + fuchs converter (TG049) 
installed on panel 9S-UCP-2202A / MP7 (E-House). After 
normalizing  the connections  at JB, the output cables of the 
Pepperl + Fuchs converters (TG049 and TG051) corresponding  to 
the respective sensors TE-2257-49 and TE-2257-51 were reversed. 
Upon checking the readings again, both sensors were indicating  
51°C. Following  this, the reversal of the output cables of these 
converters was corrected, and the sensor readings on the FCS 
remained consistent. Possibly, there was a bad connection in the 
output connectors of converter TG049 (corresponding  to sensor 
TE-2257-49), causing the difference in readings compared to TE-
2257-51.

EVENT DESCRIPTION 
Following  a surge event on compressor,  an unusual vibration behavior was observed in the connecting  rod from Vorecon gearbox, which 
were object of study and analyses from Modec  and Shape.
During the investigation  and the alignments  with both teams, initial analyzes on lube oil filters indicated contamination  by non-ferrous 
materials. Due to this contamination,  the engineering  department requested a borescope to check the internal bearings of the torque 
converter, which, at first, no signs of internal wear were detected, however, it was recommended  that the top covers be disassembled,  
and the temperature  sensors and lubrication  lines disconnected  to perform borescope examination  on the bearings.
Further, in alignments  with Voith, Vorecon gearbox vendor, they shared that there is a probable design limitation on the MV30’s 
Reinjection  Compressor  Gearbox, which must have a limited operational  condition. The B6 bearing suffers overload when the 
compressor  is operating under 8748 rpm. Considering  the Vorecon’s map, which is attached, and the actual designed condition, the 
compressor  must not operate with speeds over 8748 rpm until some kind of revamp is performed at the equipment .
A technical query (TQ-MV30-25-0107) was implemented  by CCC Modec team performing  a logical restriction with the performance  
override concept and will limit the speed in 8748 rpm, ensuring that it won’t be demanded  to operate above this condition.
Besides, considering  the severity of the event and planning,  the costs related to the revamp intervention  was emitted on budget/2026.

The compressor operates mostly at low speed, since the 
reinjection  pressure in the wells is lower than the original 
design, conflicting  with what was designed by Voith, as it was 
expected that the longest operating time would be at a speed 
greater than 8750 rpm (to the right of the vertical red line), as 
can be seen in Figure 1 below.
With prolonged  compressor  operation in the low-speed range, 
the Vorecrn driven gear system works in the opposite direction 
to the main shaft, causing constant mechanical  wear and 
drastically  reducing the lifespan of the bearings and bushings in 
this system.
TECHNICAL QUERY (TQ)
• Introduction: During operation of the Reinjection Compressor Alpha (CBA-2430A) on the MV30, abnormalities were identified in its control 
variables, leading to the opening of the equipment and the visualization of damage to the external Vorecon system bearings. Internal 
inspection of the compressor led to an analysis of the cause of this damage and a subsequent action plan for the operation of the equipment 
from that point onward until its overhaul;
• New operation range: Following the described scenario, the A/B reinjection compressors must be operated differently to ensure system 
continuity. Spare bearing parts are currently being acquired, with no estimated arrival date. The information follows documents 0478-94-
2450-E11-0001-001 and 0478-94-2450-G21-0001-001, using the sixth operating case, which is most like the recent real-world history of the 
MV30.
• Conclusion: After the procedural analysis regarding the new operating method of the Alpha and Bravo reinjection compressors, operational 
flow and discharge pressure limits were imposed on both pieces of equipment. It is understood that there are no concerns in implementing 
the "Performance Override Control" because this system provides a necessary safety margin for the equipment, which cannot operate below 
8750 rpm. If maximum reinjection is required, both compressors will operate in parallel. In the case of maximum export, we will have the flow 
limitation described above. After the compressors are overhauled, the bearings will be replaced, and the operating logic will remain the 
same. 
Regarding  the Alpha Compressor,  with the bearing already 
damaged, the Vorecron will be mechanically  fixed using plates, 
making the system's rotation fixed at 8750 rpm as a backup. 
Figure shows the operating curve based on different equipment 
rotations, for a fixed composition  with approximately  56% CO2 
originating  from the permeate of CO2 Removal only. The 8750 
rpm rotation is marked in red, and the figure also shows the flow 
rate and discharge pressure limits to prevent further 
degradation  of this compressor .

POTENTIAL SAVING ASSESSMENT
EVENT DESCRIPTION 
Lighthouse scaling models alarmed due to decreased flow with pressure drop not following the expected decrease (Figure 1) on Crude Heater A for 
MV26 as higher pressure drop on lower flowrates indicates signs of scaling in the Crude Heater system. It was also identified that the Heating Medium 
temperature was increased to compensate the decreased efficiency. 
In Figure 2, the green curve is plotted using data from the equipment datasheet with an added 15% tolerance margin. The plotted data indicates a 
scaling formation risk/presence is high since data points from the differential pressure deviate from the expected operating range.

EVENT DESCRIPTION
Shape PdM System triggered an alarm for VRU compressor,  which is monitored  by 104 online parameters . It was identified a  drop on 
lube oil pressure bearing header during operation, as measured by parameter PI-2134-01. Despite this behavior, it was expected a growth 
tendency, which means that there is a possibility  of failure on valve. Consequently,  Shape System prevented a potential bearing damage 
due to low lube oil pressure bearing header.
Description of the Corrective Maintenance:
Predictive monitoring identified a drop in the oil 
supply pressure to the VRU and a drop in the 
pressure differential, indicating that the filter is not 
saturating.
We recommend that the PCV2134-03 is properly 
functioning and has its set set at 200kPag.
Activities:
After starting up the VRU, an adjustment was made 
to PCV-2134-03 in accordance with the pressure 
required in the notification.

• Notification Conclusion Date: 2025-04-16.
• Confirmed by: Supervisor I&C.
Activities:
An initial external inspection of the transmitter was performed, and no 
installation faults and/or mechanical damage were identified. A check 
was made of the transducer with remote seal (HP Side) and cleaning, 
and no damage was observed on the transducer and the oil had a good 
color and viscosity, with no material adhered to the diaphragm. A check 
was made of the transmitter calibration, and no deviations from the zero 
and span calibration were identified. Values found: LRV: -716 mmH2O 
and URV: -290 mmH2O; SPAN: 426 mmH2OValues left: LRV: -716 
mmH2O and URV: -290 mmH2O; SPAN: 426 mmH2OAfter maintenance, 
the transmitter indication was checked against the LG-1546A-02. There is 
an approximate difference of 10% in the indication due to the LG impulse 
sockets being installed at a different height than the LIT-1546A-01 
sockets. The transmitter is operating normally, without failures. The 
transmitter is in normal operating conditions.
